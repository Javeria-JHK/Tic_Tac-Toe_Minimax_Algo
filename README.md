# Tic_Tac-Toe_Minimax_Algo
This project provides a Python-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, offering both a two-player mode for human opponents and a single-player mode against a computer adversary powered by the minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Two Player Mode:** Play against a friend on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to form a line of 'X' or 'O' horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Single Player Mode:** Challenge the computer in a strategic game where the minimax algorithm guides the computer opponent's moves.
- **Graphical User Interface:** The Tkinter GUI provides an interactive and visually appealing platform for playing the game.
- **Customization:** Customize the game experience with dynamic board displays, sound effects, and other visual elements.
